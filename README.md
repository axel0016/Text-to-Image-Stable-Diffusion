# CIFAR-10 Text-to-Image Stable Diffusion Training

This project demonstrates the training of a **Stable Diffusion model** on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** to create a **Text-to-Image generation model**. The model uses a combination of textual prompts and the CIFAR-10 image dataset to train a generative model that can produce images based on textual descriptions.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to train a **Stable Diffusion model** using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which contains **60,000 labeled images** across **10 different classes**. Each image class is paired with a corresponding text description, allowing the model to learn associations between images and text.

## Features
- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Trains a diffusion model to generate images from textual descriptions.
- **Use of CIFAR-10 Dataset:** Employs the CIFAR-10 dataset with image labels converted to corresponding text descriptions.
- **Stable Diffusion Framework:** Utilizes a state-of-the-art **Stable Diffusion** model for generating realistic images.
- **Customizable Training Parameters:** Allows users to configure training parameters, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
